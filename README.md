# Package-Tracker(WIP)

App for keeping track of packages. 

Application for Trackinge Packages made with Flutter.

### Development Status
This app is currently put on hold for now. I couldn't find a good way/api to get the package info. Initially used [This API](https://tracker.delivery/guide) but it returned 504 and 502 error pretty frequently, so I figured I couldn't use it reliably.

So far, the app has the basic functions implemented, just doesn't have a reliable API to use. Also needed to implement some extra functions, but I just didn't add it. Below are some screenshots of the app.

I was able to use the [dropdown_search package](https://pub.dev/packages/dropdown_search) which was really nice. Feel free to take a look at how to use it.
